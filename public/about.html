<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a software engineering student at Edo University,
   currently figuring out how to balance the grind of school with 
   the bigger dreams I’ve got for my future. Over the course of my study,
   I’ve realized that coding isn’t just something I’m learning for grades—it’s
   something that actually excites me. I mess around with web development,
   explore programming languages, and try to push myself into building things that feel
   real, not just assignments for class.</p>

<p>At the same time, I’m always on this self-improvement journey.
   I’m not just chasing grades, I’m chasing discipline, consistency,
   and becoming the best version of myself. I know the process isn’t easy,
   but I’ve got that drive to aim for big things—like hitting a 5.0 GPA,
   improving my technical skills, and building projects that actually matter.
   I believe that if I stay locked in and keep refining my habits,
   I can transform where I’m at now into where I want to be.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I’ve got a creative side too. I’m into fashion,
   I care about how I present myself, and I like blending logic with style—it’s
   like writing code but in aesthetic form. I want to grow into someone who’s 
   not just book-smart, but also innovative, balanced, and adaptable. 
   Every step I take now is a brick in the foundation of the person I’m building, and I’m committed to 
   making sure that the version of me in the future is someone I’ll be proud of.</p>
